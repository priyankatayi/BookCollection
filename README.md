#  Application : Book Collection 

As part of this project, I have developed an application with below functionality:

**1. Browse Books**
- Based on the keyword provided in search, it would fetch data from Google Books API and display the list of books that matches the keyword.
- The user can click on a particular book from the search results to view its full information.
- User can then add that particular book to his collection or go back to the search results.

**2. My Collection**
- Based on the search results, the user can add a book to his collection (Writes the data into database).
- My collection tab displays the list of books that were added to his collection (Reads the data from database).
- He can also remove a book from his collection (Deletes the data from database).

**Concepts Used**: Conatainer and Nested Components, Routing, Dependency Injection, Lifecyle hooks, Custom Pipes, services, CanActivate Guard, Error Handling, Input and Output properties, HTTP Client, setter and getter metthods
